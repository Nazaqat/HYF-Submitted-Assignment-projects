Data USA:

Introduction
The Data USA API allows users to explore the entire database using carefully constructed query strings, returning data as JSON results. All of the visualizations on the page have a "show data" button on their top-right that displays the API call(s) used to generate that visualization. Additionally, the new Viz Builder is a great way to explore what's possible. This page illustrates an example usage of exploring geographic data.

How it works!
It sends data requests to different data sources i.e.Agency for Health Research and Quality & represents response to users received from database. 


JSON Data Type: Object (array of object)
