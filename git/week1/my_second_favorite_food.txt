Grilled Peach Caprese

Grilled Peach Caprese ~ grilled sweet peaches, summer tomatoes, fresh mozzarella or burrata, salty prosciutto, basil and a drizzle of balsamic reduction. A delicious update to a classic.  
I originally published this recipe in 2015 as one of my first recipes, so if you’ve been following since then maybe you remember it and notice a couple of changes; maybe you’ve even made this recipe. If not, for the love of summer, add it to the top of your list.  
This salad needed better photos that show how much I love this recipe. I love it in the way Oprah expressed her love of bread in the Weight Watcher commercials and because of that, I want you to love Grilled Peach Caprese, too.
