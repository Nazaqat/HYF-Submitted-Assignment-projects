	select count(*) from hyf_database.task where due_date is NULL;

3-	Find all the tasks that are marked as done
	select * from hyf_database.task where status_id=3;

4-	Find all the tasks that are not marked as done
	select * from hyf_database.task where status_id!=3; OR
	select * from hyf_database.task where status_id<3;

5-	Get all the tasks, sorted with the most recently created first

8-	Get the title and status (as text) of all tasks
	select task.title, status.name from hyf_database.task
	inner join hyf_database.status
	on task.status_id = status.id;

9-	Get the name of each status, along with a count of how many tasks have that status
	SELECT count(task.id) ,status.name  FROM task 
	join status  on task.status_id = status.id 
	group by status.name;

10-	Get the names of all statuses, sorted by the status with most tasks first
	SELECT count(task.id) ,status.name  FROM task 
	join status  on task.status_id = status.id 
	group by status.name
